💻 I hold a Master's degree in Machine Learning and Data Mining from Université Jean Monnet in France. During my studies, I also participated in the ERASMUS mobility at the University of Freiburg in Germany.

🧠 My passion lies in data analysis, knowledge retrieval, and machine learning. I am particularly interested in deploying machine learning models as a service to benefit society and in building optimized pipelines for generative AI systems.

🔧 I currently work as a Technical Consultant at Herzum, a company specialized in DevOps consulting, where I support cloud migrations and contribute to the design of LLM-powered tools and chatbots.

🚀 I enjoy challenging problems, whether it’s fine-tuning neural networks or adapting deep learning models to specific tasks. I'm always curious and eager to keep learning.
