💻 I hold a Master’s degree in Machine Learning and Data Mining from Université Jean Monnet in France. During my studies, I also participated in the ERASMUS mobility at the University of Freiburg in Germany.

🧠 Data Analysis is the first of my passions, and this passion has also expanded to machine learning use. I am particularly interested in the use of machine learning models as a service to benefit society and in building optimized pipelines for generative AI systems.

🔧 I currently work as a Technical Consultant at Herzum, a company specialized in DevOps consulting, where I support cloud migrations and contribute to the design of LLM-powered tools and chatbots.

🚀 I enjoy challenging problems, I am actively participating in Kaggle competitions where I can work with real world problems and a wide variety of datasets. Check my portfolio where you can see what I am currently working on!
