👋🏼 Hello there, I'm Cesar!

💻 I'm a Machine Learning and Data Mining master's student at Université Jean Monnet in France, currently finishing my final year. I also spent a semester at the University of Freiburg in Germany through the Erasmus program.

🧠 My passions lie in data analysis, knowledge retrieval, and machine learning. I'm especially interested in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) for real-world solutions and building optimized pipelines for generative AI systems.

🔧 I currently work as a Technical Consultant at Herzum, where I support cloud migrations and contribute to the design of LLM-powered tools and chatbots.

🚀 I enjoy challenging problems, whether it’s fine-tuning neural networks or adapting deep learning models to specific tasks. I'm always curious and eager to keep learning.

### 🧪 Selected Experience

#### 🛠️ Open Source & Projects

I’ve worked on domain adaptation techniques to improve LLM performance and developed a CNN model for priority assignment based on user inputs. You can find my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/cesar) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/cesaranasco/code).

📄 I’ve also published research on detecting SQL injection attacks using data mining methods — [read it here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370481672_Using_Data_Mining_Techniques_for_the_Detection_of_SQL_Injection_Attacks_on_Database_Systems).

#### 🧩 Independent Research & Implementation

I’ve reimplemented LLM fine-tuning strategies and deployed MLOps pipelines to streamline experimentation. This hands-on work fuels my goal of bringing research closer to production environments.
