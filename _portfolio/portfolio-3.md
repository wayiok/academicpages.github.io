To advance the field of automated skin cancer detection, the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) has launched this competition. This challenge aims to:

Improve accuracy in distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions
Enhance efficiency in clinical workflows
Develop algorithms capable of prioritizing high-risk lesions
Ultimately reduce mortality rates associated with skin cancer through early detection
The competition provides smartphone-quality images of skins lesions. From these images the goal is to detect the probability of skin cancer.

The ISIC 2024 Challenge focuses on:

Binary classification of skin lesions (malignant vs. benign/intermediate)
Utilization of 3D Total Body Photography (TBP) derived images
Integration of patient metadata for improved diagnosis
Prioritization of lesions for clinical review
3D Total Body Photography (TBP) plays a pivotal role in this challenge, offering comprehensive imaging of a patient's entire skin surface. This technology is crucial for:

Detecting new lesions
Monitoring changes in existing lesions
Providing context for individual lesion assessment
Enabling efficient full-body skin examinations
